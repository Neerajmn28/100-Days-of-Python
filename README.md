## Turtle Crossing Game
Description
This is a simple Turtle Crossing Game built using Python's turtle module. The player controls a turtle that must cross a road while avoiding moving cars. The game gets progressively harder as the player advances through levels.

Features
* Player Movement: Move the turtle upwards using the Up Arrow key.
* Obstacle Cars: Cars spawn randomly and move from right to left.
* Scoreboard: Displays the current level and updates upon successful crossings.
* Game Over Condition: The game ends if the turtle collides with a car.
