# 100 Days of Python 🐍

Welcome to the **100 Days of Python** learning! 
🚀 This repository documents my journey to master Python, covering everything from the fundamentals to advanced concepts, projects, and real-world applications.


## Project Description
This project is a classic Snake Game built using Python’s Turtle module. The game features a moving snake that grows in length as it consumes food, with the goal of achieving the highest possible score without colliding with the walls or itself.

Features
* Snake Movement: The snake moves in four directions—up, down, left, and right—using keyboard controls.
* Food Generation: The game randomly places food on the screen, and the snake consumes it to grow.
* Scoreboard System: Displays the current score and keeps track of the highest score.
* Collision Detection: The game detects when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
* Game Reset: The game resets when the player loses, updating the high score and restarting the snake.
* Smooth Animation: The game uses the screen.tracer(0) and screen.update() functions to create smooth animations.

## Turtle Crossing Game
Description
This is a simple Turtle Crossing Game built using Python's turtle module. The player controls a turtle that must cross a road while avoiding moving cars. The game gets progressively harder as the player advances through levels.

Features
* Player Movement: Move the turtle upwards using the Up Arrow key.
* Obstacle Cars: Cars spawn randomly and move from right to left.
* Scoreboard: Displays the current level and updates upon successful crossings.
* Game Over Condition: The game ends if the turtle collides with a car.

## Pomodoro Timer
Project Overview: The Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool designed to help users stay focused and manage their work and break intervals efficiently. Based on the popular Pomodoro Technique, this app divides work into 25-minute intervals (called Pomodoros) separated by short breaks. After completing four Pomodoros, users are rewarded with a longer break. The timer provides a visual countdown and checkmarks to track the number of completed work sessions.

Key Features:

* Start & Reset Functionality: Users can start and reset the timer with simple button clicks.
* Visual Timer: A dynamic countdown timer is displayed, showing minutes and seconds.
* Work & Break Sessions: The timer alternates between work and break intervals, with distinct colors to differentiate between the two (green for work, pink for short breaks, red for long breaks).
* Progress Tracker: Checkmarks appear after each completed work session to show the user their progress.
* Customizable Intervals: Users can modify work, short break, and long break durations based on their preference.
