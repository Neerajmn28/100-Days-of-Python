        "Project Description: Blackjack Game in Python This project is a simple implementation of the Blackjack card game built using Python. The game allows a single user to play against the computer (dealer) in a simulated Blackjack environment. The program simulates drawing cards, calculates scores, handles the rules of Blackjack (like checking for \"Blackjack\" or busting), and compares the final scores to determine the winner.\n",
