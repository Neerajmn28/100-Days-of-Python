# Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In simple terms:

# Polymorphism means "many forms" â€” the same function or method can behave differently depending on the object calling it.

# Define an abstract class

# Derived class 1
