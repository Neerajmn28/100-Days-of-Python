        "Description:\n",
        "The Number Guessing Game is a simple and interactive Python project where users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game challenges players with two difficulty levels: \"Easy\" and \"Hard.\" Each level determines the number of attempts the player has to correctly guess the number. Feedback is provided for each guess, guiding the player if their guess is \"too high\" or \"too low.\" The game concludes when the player guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using Python's randint function.\n",
        "* Difficulty Levels:\n",
        "Easy Mode: Players have 10 attempts to guess the number.\n",
        "Hard Mode: Players have 5 attempts to guess the number.\n",
        "Input Validation: The game accepts user input and ensures guesses are checked against the random number, reducing remaining attempts as necessary.\n",
        "User Feedback: For every incorrect guess, the game provides a hintâ€”either \"Too High\" or \"Too Low.\"\n",
        "Game Loop: A while loop ensures that the game continues until the user guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts."
