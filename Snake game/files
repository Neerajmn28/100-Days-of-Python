Project Structure

|-- main.py         # Main game loop
|-- snake.py        # Snake class for movement and growth
|-- food.py         # Food class for random spawning

The snake moves automatically.

When the snake eats food, it grows and the score increases.

If the snake collides with the wall or its own tail, the game ends.
